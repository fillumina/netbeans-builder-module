OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Adds three new code generators: constants, fluent setters and builder. \
    Constants are useful when you access fields via reflection. \
    Fluent setters are setters named like the field they set that return "this" so that they can be used one after the other in a way called "fluent interface". \
    The builder adds an inner class named "Builder", a static method that creates the class and a private constructor to the bean.
